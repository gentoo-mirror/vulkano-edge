# Notes

- Doing a ```emerge --sync``` should update the repo when updating gentoo
- For using an older package, Gentoo likes to update the package to the latest unless specified in ```/etc/portage/..``` for more information visit the gentoo wiki here at https://wiki.gentoo.org to prevent Gentoo from updating the package to v1.3.210
